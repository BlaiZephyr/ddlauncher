my first attempt on actual coding in go

TODO:
[x] UI
[x] Version selection
[x] Client Downloading
[x] Client launching
[ ] strip away the release candidates from github tags
[ ] make the list not fill up the entire screen
[ ] Antibot integration for all types of servers (this is a joke, but i do want to provide some sort of moderation integration within here. 
[ ] provide a Translation GUI, preferrably with deepl
[ ] Get actually good at UI making
[ ] step away from fyne, use a different frontend, maybe different language, go isn't GUI'ing the way i expected to GUI
[ ] Validation of an existing data folder to not bloat up disk space
